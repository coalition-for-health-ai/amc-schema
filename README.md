# CHAI Applied Model Card

## About

The CHAI Applied Model Card describes an AI solution focused on the application in a health use case. This model card supports meeting the criteria for HTI-1 for predictive DSIs defined as "...technology that supports decision-making based on algorithms or models that derive relationships from training data and then produce an output that results in prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis." In addition, this model card provides transparency for all Five of CHAIâ€™s Principles of Responsible AI (Transparency, Safety, Security & Privacy, Fairness & Bias, and Usefulness).

In this current draft release we have included:
- the complete documentation for the model card (includes: instructions, example, resources, references)
- a fillable template of the model card
- a schema defining a structured format for which applications should produce and consume Applied Model Cards
- an Applied Model Card instance document for the example provided in the full documentation
